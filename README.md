# eduroam-linux-UoP (W.I.P.)

Rewriting the eduroam configation script of the University of PÃ©cs.

The [original one](https://github.com/clyhtsuriva/eduroam-linux-UoP/blob/main/eduroam-linux-UoP-original.py), as of today (2022/07/03 23:07:11), can be found [there](https://cat.eduroam.org/user/API.php?action=downloadInstaller&api_version=2&lang=en&device=linux&profile=8533).

## Purpose

The script is kindo old since it's using "natively" python2 which is deprecated since January 1st, 2022.

Apart from that, some programming issues can be found.

By programming error, I mean "things not to do".
